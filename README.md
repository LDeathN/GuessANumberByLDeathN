"Guess The Number" is a classic game where one player thinks of a secret number within a predetermined range, and the other player or players take turns guessing what it is. The player who is guessing receives feedback after each guess (typically "higher" or "lower"), helping them hone in on the correct number through a process of elimination. The game continues until the guesser correctly identifies the secret number or reaches a pre-defined limit of attempts.

## How It Works?

First the computer chooses a number from 1-100.

After that the player chooses the difficulty for the current game.

The game continues until the player either has no more attempts or has guessed the number.

At the end of every game you will be asked if you want to start another one.

Finally once you decided you had enough playing you will see the final statistics: games won; games played
